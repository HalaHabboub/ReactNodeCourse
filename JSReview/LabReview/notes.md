# 📝 Notes about the asynchronous lab

Some notes the Dr gave us about the lab in class.
We will rely on promises (.then)
---

## 1. Dealing with Fetch

create a normal function -> takes ID -> returns user info based on ID.
if user not found return user not found error (using .catch instead of .then).


## 2. Get post by user

create second function : get post by user.

## 3. chaining

create third function : chaining.
